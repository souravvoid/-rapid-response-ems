Our Project aims to develop a Rapid Response System For Emergency Medical Services for EMS ,
connecting users , hospitals and ambulance in single platform. The approach is systemic ,starting from understanding
problem to complete working demo.

1.Problem Analysis
• study current EMS workflow, ambulance and hospitals preparation gaps.

2.planning and flowchart
Define system module
• User Module
• Ambulance module
• Hospitals module

3.Algorithm & calculation
• use of algorithms to calculate fastest routes considering traffic.
• Calculate ETA based on distance ,traffic , and ambulance.

4.Tech stack
• Frontend : HTML/CSS ,Javascript
• Backend : Python(flask) for server logic and algorithms
• Database : Mysql or Firebase for real -time data(optional)
• Mapping Traffic:APIS google maps or openstreet maps
• Version & IDE : Vscode, Git,Github
• OS: window 11,linux distro

5.Testing
• Unit testing :check each module individually
• Integration Testing : Test all module together

6. Output
The user receives confirmation that help is on the way.
The hospital dashboard shows ETA and patient detail for prepartion
The systems assigns the fastest ambulance or the shortest alternate route
